Here, the employer is not aware of the exact performance the candidate will provide after joining. Also, there is an ambiguity about whether the candidate will be right fit in as the employee of the organization. Thus, by assigning probation, the organization checks the performance of the newly joined employee and ensures their integration in the organization. The probationary process provides an opportunity for the employer to verify the suitability of the employee for the assigned job and then take an appropriate decision about retention or </span></span><u><span xss="removed"><strong><a href="https://www.hrhelpboard.com/contract-letters/termination-letter.html"><span xss="removed">termination of the employee</span></a></strong></span><span xss="removed"><span xss="removed">.</span></span></u></span></p>

<p><span xss="removed"><span xss="removed"><span xss="removed">Innovation is key to success, and thus in each and every part of probation rules there are some companies which use idea which are employee friendly. Innovation in terms of lower the anxiety and uncertainty in the environment is a way to make the new employee feel comfortable in the organization. Such project is run by Infosys which is termed as &lsquo;Buddy&rsquo;. Here, apart from manager, another senior team member has given responsibility to help in adjustment of new employee in probation period. The team member will help new employees to understand the terms and conditions of the probation period and support them to improve their performance. In this way it will be easy for new employee to successfully complete the probation period and </span><strong><a href="https://www.hrhelpboard.com/contract-letters/confirmation-letter.html"><span xss="removed">receive confirmation letter</span></a></strong><span xss="removed">.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p><span xss="removed"><span xss="removed"><span xss="removed">Another innovative practice is carried out in various universities. In the academic area it is difficult to start teaching the student on the very first day on joining. During probation period the new employee are worried about the way student will react and how they will rate their teaching. Thus, during probation period some universities allow the new employee joined on the junior level to attend the class of a senior employee. In this way the employee can take notes about how to handle the class and can observer the students reaction. At the end of the session the senior employee introduce the new employee to the students and thus provide a happy starting to their career. This is a best innovative way to reduce the anxiety, provide clarity about work profile and help the new employee to complete the probation period in satisfactory manner.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
